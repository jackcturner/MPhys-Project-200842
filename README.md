Codes used in the analysis of the TNG and GAMA data in 'Comparing the Galaxy-Halo Connection in the TNG
Simulations and GAMA Survey'. The codes are separated for GAMA and TNG analysis and the HOD and spatial studies. GAMA_HOD.py performs the volume limiting and HOD parameterisation, GAMA_Spatial.py performs the volume limiting but with plots omitted and determines the spatial distribution. TNG_HOD.py is the TNG HOD parameterisation and TNG_Spatial determines the TNG spatial distribution.
